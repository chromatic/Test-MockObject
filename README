Test::MockObject version 0.15
=============================

* NOTES *

You can now skip logging certain mocked methods in T::MO and T::MO::E version 0.15.  Finally!

I've added Test::MockObject:Extends in version 0.14.  This required making
Test::MockObject a little more subclassable.

As of version 0.12, I've fixed the false positives in called_ok().  Jay Bonci
found this one and wrote the test case.  Oops.

As of version 0.11, I've fixed a potential infinite loop with a set_series()
mocked method called in list context.  Yuck.

As of version 0.10, mock objects no longer store their state within the objects
themselves.  That also means that you can have mock objects that aren't hash
references. Nifty.

As of version 0.09, method chaining works for mocking methods.  Handy!  Use it!

As of version 0.07, the add() method has been deprecated in favor of mock().
It continues to work, for backwards compatibility purposes, but you are
encouraged to migrate to mock().  (Thank you for using the module, though.  :)

Test::MockObject is a highly polymorphic testing object, capable of looking
like all sorts of objects.  This makes white-box testing much easier, as you
can concentrate on what the code being tested sends to and receives from the
mocked object, instead of worrying about faking up your own data.  (Another
option is not to test difficult things.  Now you have no excuse.)

Please note that it is possible to write highly detailed unit tests that pass
even when your integration tests may fail.  Testing the pieces individually
does not excuse you from testing the whole thing together.  I consider this to
be a feature.
